3. Generated Clocks
  
-- Clock which is derived from the master clock.
 
   -- If there's a /3 circuitry, once would define a generated clock definition at the output
      of this circuitry
   -- Definingn a new clock as generated clock doesn't create a new clock domain and the generated clock
      is considered to be in phase with the master clock
   -- In a master clock, clock definition point is the origin of the master clock 
   -- In a generated clock, clock definition point is the master clock
   -- "The start point of a clock path is always the master clock definition point"
   -- Advantage of generating a clock :
          " Source latency is not automatically included"
   -- Methods to create a generated clock using :
      -- "-edges"
      -- "create_generated_clock"
      -- "-invert" 
-- Clock latency for Generated Clocks
   -- A source latency specified on a generated clock specifies the latency from the defition
      of the master clock to the definition of the generated clock.
   -- Total clock latency (Generated Clock) = Source latency (Master + Generated clock ) + Network Latency (Generated Clock)

-- Typical Clock generation scenario
   -- Assume an Oscillator which is external to the chip produces a low freq clock which is used as a reference
      clock by the on-chip PLL to generate a high-frequency low-jitter clock.
   -- This clock is then fed to a clock divider that generates the required clocks for the ASIC
   -- A master clock is defined for the referenc clock at the input pin where it enters the chip and a 
      seocond master clock is defined at the output of the PLL.
   -- PLL output clock has no phase relationship with the reference clock.
      Hence, output clock shouldn't be a generated clock of the reference clock.
   -- All clocks generated by the clock divider logic are specified as generated clocks of
      the master clock at the PLL out-put.

4. Constraining the Input paths

    -- STA cannot check any timing on a path that is not constrained. All paths must be constrained to enable 
       their analysis
